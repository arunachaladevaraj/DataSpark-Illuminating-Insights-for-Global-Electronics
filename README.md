    GROUP BY 
        City, State, Country, Continent;
    ```

- **Purchase Patterns**: Identify purchasing patterns such as average order value, frequency of purchases, and preferred products.
    ```sql
    -- Average Order Value and Number of Purchases per Customer
    SELECT 
        CustomerKey,
        AVG(Revenue) AS AverageOrderValue,
        COUNT(OrderNumber) AS NumberOfPurchases
    FROM 
        Sales
    GROUP BY 
        CustomerKey;

    -- Purchase Frequency by Product
    SELECT 
        ProductName, 
        COUNT(OrderNumber) AS PurchaseFrequency
    FROM 
        Sales
    GROUP BY 
        ProductName;
    ```

- **Customer Segmentation**: Segment customers based on demographics and purchasing behavior to identify key customer groups.
    ```sql
    SELECT 
        Gender, 
        FLOOR(DATEDIFF(YEAR, Birthday, CURDATE())/10)*10 AS AgeGroup,
        AVG(Revenue) AS AverageOrderValue
    FROM 
        Customers
    INNER JOIN 
        Sales ON Customers.CustomerKey = Sales.CustomerKey
    GROUP BY 
        Gender, 
        AgeGroup;
    ```

### Sales Analysis

- **Overall Sales Performance**: Analyze total sales over time, identifying trends and seasonality.
    ```sql
    SELECT 
        DATE_FORMAT(OrderDate, '%Y-%m') AS Month, 
        SUM(Revenue) AS TotalSales
    FROM 
        Sales
    GROUP BY 
        Month;
    ```

- **Sales by Product**: Evaluate which products are the top performers in terms of quantity sold and revenue generated.
    ```sql
    SELECT 
        ProductName, 
        SUM(QuantitySold) AS TotalQuantitySold, 
        SUM(Revenue) AS TotalRevenue
    FROM 
        Sales
    GROUP BY 
        ProductName;
    ```
